lifted-wordnet-domains
======================

wordnet-domains mapped to Wordnet 3.0

One of the challenges in using wordnet-domauns is that it is available in two different versions,
for Wordnet 1.6 and for Wordnet 2.0, both of which are obselete. There are some mapping files 
available in various places to lift nouns and verbs to higher versions of Wordnet, but nothing for
adjectives or adverbs.

This contains a lifted version of wordnet-domains-3.2, to Wordnet 3.0. There is a 3.1 version, but
mapping to that is harder as there are no synset maps from 3.0 to 3.1. The Perl script that did the
lifting is also included.

No warranty whatsoever, obviously. And all the factotum entries are filtered out as I didn't
need them for my purposes.
